# RezerwacjeHotelowe

Hotel booking system, which is made using Java and frameworks like JavaFX, Spring and Hibernate. It is
windowed program that is made for two types of users - people who want to book a room and hotel staff to efﬁciently manage reservations. Hibernate made it easy to implement all database operations and Spring to test it using objects injections. There are all built in login, registering, conﬁrming account and reseting password using email. As well as safety algorithms that prevent such actions as double reservation, there is a built in mechanism to block reservation when someone is in reservation process of that room for 5 minutes. Of course we made sure that there is no option to make SQL Injection attack and used password encryption in operations to database using bCrypt hash algorithm. Made in a team of two people.
